## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# B. Improved analysis code (bio3d)
<small> # The inputs of the function are the protein PDB accession, chain, and atom type.
 The function plots the bfactor (the displacement of the atomic positions from an average 
 value) for each residue of specified PDB accession, chain and atom type.
 The output of the function is a plot. X axis is residue and Y axis is bfactor value.
 
```{r}
library(bio3d) 
plot <- function(accession, cha, ele) {
  s <- read.pdb(accession)
  s.chainX <- trim.pdb(s, chain = cha, elety = ele)
  s.b <- s.chainX$atom$b
  plotb3(s.b, sse=s.chainX, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")
}
```

tests:
```{r}
plot("4AKE", "A", "CA")
plot("1AKE", "A", "CA")
plot("1E4Y", "A", "CA")
```
